## Bank Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 📉🧠
### Overview

Welcome to the Bank Churn Prediction project! 🎉 This repository is dedicated to predicting customer churn in the banking sector using cutting-edge Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Customer attrition is a major challenge for banks, affecting their profitability and growth. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, banks can implement targeted strategies to retain them and boost their bottom line. 💸

### Project Description

Our mission is to develop a powerful predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning based on their transactional and demographic data. With the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), we uncover patterns and relationships in the data to make accurate predictions. 🤖✨

### Features

  - Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for optimal model training. 🧹📊
  - Feature Engineering: Create and select impactful features from raw data. 🔍🔧
  - Model Building: Build and train an ANN model using TensorFlow and Keras. 🏗️📈
  - Evaluation: Assess the model's performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 📉🔍
  - Visualization: Visualize model performance and insights with beautiful charts. 📊📈

### Dataset

This project uses a dataset that includes customer demographics, account details, and transaction history. It is sourced from publicly available datasets or simulated data to represent real-world banking scenarios. 📋🔍

### Requirements

    Python 3.x 🐍
    TensorFlow 📚
    Keras 🔧
    Pandas 📊
